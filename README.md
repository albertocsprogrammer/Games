# Games
This is a repository for me to make simple java games in. They have *super creative* names like __Pong Clone__ and __Movable Block__.
Each game is in their own folder (ie *Pong Clone* is in the Pong Clone folder), and the .jar files are in the *jars* directory in each game's folder.

### Notice Reguarding compatibility issues ###
As of me writing this, these games are compiled using JDK 7 and need at least Java 7 to run. If you are running the Apple version of java, THESE WILL NOT WORK. Apple has it's own version of java that is not up-to-date (it's version is 6) and it will not load. Also if you are on a PC that is using java < 7, this will not work either. Newer versions are available from [java.com](http://java.com/) (honestly their site looks really shady, with big red "Free Download" buttons. But trust me, that site is legit.)

I'm working on getting the lowest compatible version down to 1.6.0, so expect this message to be gone in a day or two (or less!).
